Then, explore the scripts in this repo and run them. There are 2 types of scripts in this repo:

1. Python scripts
2. Bash shell scripts

Just change to the corresponding directory and run the scripts there. Of course, you want to read the scripts and understand them before running them. Each script is independent and standalone.

For example,

```
cd python
python send-single-telegram-text.py
```
